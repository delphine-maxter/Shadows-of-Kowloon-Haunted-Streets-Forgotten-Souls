    <!-- St Andrew's Church -->
    <section class="stop" id="st-andrews">
      <h2>St Andrew’s Church</h2>
      <img src="images/st-andrews.jpg" alt="St Andrew’s Church banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> Founded in 1904 and consecrated in 1906, St Andrew’s is a Victorian Gothic brick church designed by Leigh &amp; Orange. It is listed as a Grade I historic building and, during the Second World War, was converted into a Shinto shrine under Japanese occupation before being restored.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> Parishioners have long whispered about faint organ notes after midnight and a chill in the nave when no one is present.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “The red bricks drink in the city’s hum, but when the park grows quiet a thin hymn rises—no hands on the keys, only memory.”</p>
      <p class="label"><strong>Next Segment:</strong> ~0.66 km (~8 mins)</p>

    <!-- Temple Street Night Market -->
    <section class="stop" id="temple-street">
      <h2>Temple Street Night Market</h2>
      <img src="images/temple-street.jpg" alt="Temple Street banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> Named for the nearby Tin Hau Temple, Temple Street has evolved into Hong Kong’s most storied night market—a neon-lit corridor known for street food and fortune tellers, active nightly with the best atmosphere after sunset.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> Fortune tellers say some clients leave no shadow beneath the lamps—an omen that the reading is for more than one life.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “Under paper lanterns, garlic smoke wraps the chess boards. A singer’s voice trembles; the crowd sways, but one listener never blinks.”</p>
      <p class="label"><strong>Next Segment:</strong> ~0.26 km (~3 mins)</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Tin Hau Temple -->
    <section class="stop" id="tin-hau">
      <h2>Tin Hau Temple (Yau Ma Tei)</h2>
      <img src="images/tin-hau.jpg" alt="Tin Hau Temple banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> The temple complex—among Kowloon’s largest—dates to the mid-19th century and includes halls once used for worship, arbitration and free schooling for boat and land people. Declared a monument, it anchors community life around Yung Shue Tau.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> Sailors lost to storms are said to follow incense trails back to Tin Hau’s altar on certain nights.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “Incense curls like tide-mist; a bell stirs, and the banyans bow as if to welcome arrivals from far off water.”</p>
      <p class="label"><strong>Next Segment:</strong> ~0.32 km (~4 mins)</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Yau Ma Tei Theatre -->
    <section class="stop" id="ymt-theatre">
      <h2>Yau Ma Tei Theatre</h2>
      <img src="images/ymt-theatre.jpg" alt="Yau Ma Tei Theatre banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> Built in 1930 and revived in 2012 as a Cantonese opera venue, this is Kowloon’s only surviving pre–World War II theatre. Its Art Deco façade and timber roof trusses frame a rare link between cinema and opera heritage.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> Performers speak of phantom applause and a final cue light that flickers when the house is empty.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “A single clap cracks the silence; dust motes rise, bowing where audiences once sat.”</p>
      <p class="label"><strong>Next Segment:</strong> ~0.83 km (~11 mins)</p>

    <!-- Shanghai Street (Tong Lau) -->
    <section class="stop" id="shanghai-st">
      <h2>Shanghai Street (Tong Lau Row)</h2>
      <img src="images/shanghai-st.jpg" alt="Shanghai Street banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> The pre-war shophouses (tong lau) at Nos. 600–626 are Grade I historic buildings. Tong lau typify Hong Kong’s urban past: shopfronts at street level, living quarters above, verandahs over arcades—evolving from 19th-century forms to Art Deco-influenced blocks by the 1930s.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> Residents say the corner balconies hold echoes of lullabies from families who slept above their shops.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “Balustrades peel; a radio hum wakes on its own; behind a shutter, an old ledger turns a page.”</p>
      <p class="label"><strong>Next Segment:</strong> ~1.67 km (~22 mins)</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mei Ho House -->
    <section class="stop" id="mei-ho">
      <h2>Mei Ho House</h2>
      <img src="images/mei-ho-house.jpg" alt="Mei Ho House banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> The last surviving H-block of the Shek Kip Mei resettlement estate, Mei Ho House was completed in 1954 after the devastating Christmas Day 1953 fire displaced over 53,000 residents. Today it operates as a youth hostel and museum interpreting early public housing life.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> Neighbours recall footsteps pacing the open corridors long after curfew—soft as ash, steady as routine.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “Kerosene memories flicker; enamel bowls clink; a key turns, searching for a door that moved decades ago.”</p>
      <p class="label"><strong>Next Segment:</strong> ~0.42 km (~5 mins)</p>

    <!-- Man Fat Seafood Restaurant -->
    <section class="stop" id="man-fat">
      <h2>Man Fat Seafood Restaurant</h2>
      <img src="images/man-fat.jpg" alt="Man Fat Seafood banner" class="stop-banner" />
      <p><strong>Historical Facts:</strong> A longstanding Sham Shui Po seafood spot on Fuk Wa Street, Man Fat embodies old-school Cantonese banqueting culture—live seafood, family-style dishes, and late-night gatherings. Local lore places its roots in the 1970s with a dai pai dong spirit carried into a sit-down restaurant.</p>
      <p><strong>Cultural Note (Sham Shui Po):</strong> One of Hong Kong’s oldest working-class districts, Sham Shui Po is renowned for gritty street markets, fabric and electronics arcades, and an authentic food scene that ranges from hawker classics to Michelin-recognised eateries.</p>
      <p><strong>Legend (Popular Tale):</strong> During the Hungry Ghost Festival, some say extra bowls should be set at midnight banquets—just in case.</p>
      <p><strong>Storytelling (Invented Narrative):</strong> “Steam blooms from claypot rice; a chair scrapes back on its own; the last toast is answered by a whisper.”</p>
